# About me

I'm an engineer by trade and by nature. I enjoy all kinds of development, so I tend work on all sorts of things in my spare time: libraries, open-source projects, games etc. If you have an idea or problem you think I could help with, drop me a line and I'll consider it!

For my day job, I work as a senior software engineer at [Rowden Technologies](https://www.rowdentech.com/).

# Things I like

* **Unity**: People rag on it, but if you're doing serious interactive content (and aren't willing to burn money on your own engine) there's really no better option. And hey, Unity the company is really invested in the platform and are doing a lot to make things even better.
* **C#/.NET**: As a language, C# is one of the few that has very little wrong with it. And with .NET Core, you can run it on essentially anything bar embedded systems. With CoreRT, you can do AOT compilation and build a real single-file native library or executable. With our current growth and speed of development, it's an exciting time to be in the .NET ecosystem!
* **TypeScript**: This language was a big part of what made me like the JavaScript ecosystem and workflow. All things considered, it'd be my dynamically-typed language of choice for 'serious' work. I'd pick it over Python any day.
* **Lua/LOVE**: I love Lua. Or more accurately I love the idea of Lua, if paired with a good framework - which LOVE is! The elegance, the simplicity, the speed. For huge projects it would be a nightmare, but hey so would Python, and people use that for some reason!
* **Azure devops**: Free private repositories with integrated scrum boards and the best CI I've ever used? Sign me up!
* **Azure cloud**: I'll admit I'm a bit of a Microsoft fanboy, but man, they know how to make nice interfaces!
* **DigitalOcean**: If you don't care about fully managed Azure/AWS-style setups, DO is the way to go. Easy to use, and very well priced.

# Projects

## [EdmxToEfCore](https://github.com/hamish-milne/EdmxToEfCore)

A neat little MsBuild plugin that converts database models in .edmx format to "code-first" models in EF Core. Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EdmxToEfCore/).

## [FbxWriter](https://github.com/hamish-milne/FbxWriter)

A library for manipulating FBX files in .NET. My most starred project, even though I haven't worked on it in a while! I'm considering doing a NuGet package and developing it further.

## [Upm-Git](https://github.com/hamish-milne/Upm-Git)

A little program that translates the Unity Package Manager's API calls into Git commands run locally, to allow the use of Git repositories as versioned package sources with full dependency management.

## [Reflect](https://github.com/hamish-milne/Reflect)

A library for creating strongly-typed reflection classes in .NET. Useful when dealing with APIs that have lots of internal classes you want to access (cough cough Unity)

# Games

## Ashes of Equestria

I volunteer for [The Overmare Studios](https://theovermare.com), developing a very ambitions open-world RPG based on the Fallout Equestria fan novel. (I have the possibly dubious honour as the longest standing team member: since March 2012)

## [Blades of Equestria](https://github.com/hamish-milne/Blades-Of-Equestria)

A game in the concept stage right now, BoE will be an isometric CRPG inspired by Avernum and the Divinity series, written in [LOVE](https://love2d.org).

# Work in progress

## [Decal system for Unity](https://github.com/hamish-milne/SkinnedDecals)

A powerful, feature-packed and performant decal system for Unity. Needs to be tidied up and made to work on newer versions; I hope to make this a UPM package at some point.

# Contributions

## [Citra](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra)

I'm working on a couple of graphical bugs, and (because I'm insane I guess) doing the entire save state system.

## [CoreRT](https://github.com/dotnet/corert)

## [NLua](https://github.com/NLua/NLua)
